		<div>Goal</div>
		<div>Disparities and lack of human resources in dental health

</div>
		<div>
</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>Women dentists have more tasks and distractions in their private life </div>
		<div>Time and location are the main barriers to dental care</div>
		<div>Keep society healthy 
</div>
		<div>Being healthy is a process, doctors should coach people not just cure them</div>
		<div>Lack of diversity amoung dentists causes discrimination and increases disparitie</div>
		<div>The financial resources are tight, costs and population are growing, and the system is already failed to provide dental health for lots of people. 

On the other hand, new disruptive business plans can put Dentaquest out of business.
</div>
		<div>DentaQuest departments have different agendas and capacities, sometimes they do not align or not acutely aware around the enterprise. Also, DentaQuest does not have a system to follow the ideas to implementation</div>
		<div>IOT and digital health records can help doctors to understand patient situation better and customize their treatment
</div>
		<div>Medicaid is not appealing for dentists</div>
		<div>The current model is not financially sustainable</div>
		<div>Education society/policy makers is crucial for success

</div>
		<div>Dentists time waste on the other tasks </div>
		<div>+</div>
		<div>Engaging communities/families in the process can improve the results 
</div>
		<div>Now</div>
		<div>Opportunities </div>
		<div>We do not have enough dentist for the population, 49M Americans live in the areas with the shortage of dentists. So they can not use their Medicare/Medicaid/insurance.
</div>
		<div>Educating society/policy makers is crucial for success

</div>
		<div>They have to do some tasks that they do not have not trained for, like accounting, marketing, etc. Also, some of the tasks can be done by hygienists or special person who trained for some of the services. In this way, they have more time to do what the have to do and trained for it. 
</div>
		<div>Challenges</div>
		<div>Findings:
from interviews inside of the enterprise </div>
		<div>Insights</div>
		<div>Women dentists have more distractions than their men colleagues especially if they have family and children. It forces them to work part time. 
</div>
		<div>Dentists community is not as diverse as the US population. Language and cultural barriers increase disparities and can cause discrimination. This is evident among LGBT community. The hypothesis is; dentists from these communities understand/communicate with them better, and there is a higher chance that they go back to their hometown after graduation. 
</div>
		<div>Insights
</div>
		<div>Insight 2:
Patients access to dentist limits due to time/location. Although in most cases a hygienist is enough or the doctor does not need available physically.

</div>
		<div>Insight 1:

By reducing distractions and manage the workflow of the dentist work/office/life we can increase their performance and the quality of their service. </div>
		<div>Insight 4:
Communities/families have a significant impact on the society's health make the impact sustainable. 

</div>
		<div>Insight 3:
Increasing the diversity of the dentists can reduce disparities and discrimination. 

</div>
		<div>Findings</div>
		<div>Insight 4:

Medicaid covers lots of people ( especially kids ), but the majority of dentists do not accept it. By creating fast/low cost services, we can improve the health and business. 

</div>
		<div>Insights:

</div>
		<div>Insight 3:
DentaQuest needs a system to collect ideas and assign them to a team. Also, the whole enterprise should engage in the process and the results. 

</div>
		<div>Insight 3:
Patients lifestyle is trackable, and their medical records are digital, so doctors can make better decisions and we can offer customized plans.
